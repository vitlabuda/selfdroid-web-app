class FlockBasedLock:
    """
    FlockBasedLock is a Python 3 library which allows even completely unrelated processes or threads to acquire and then
    release atomic locks bound to a specific file. As the name suggests, it uses the flock() syscall to perform the
    (un)locking.

    The locking may be performed using the "with" statement, or the acquire() and release() methods.

    The library has been written for Linux, but it will probably work on other Unixes as well.
    Tested on Debian 10 (Linux 4.19) with Python 3.7.
